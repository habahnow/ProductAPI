TODO: Table "works" try to add a new item by updating singleItemInfo.
TODO: creating tables for Price markups, price breaks and intersections of those
tables. Instead of lists im now using ints

May use a table per concrete classs Inheritance model. I'm uncertain if this is
right only because in this implementation, even the Parent class receives a
table which is pointless in my case (item class). From what i understand in the
Hibernate documentation, i could forgo an inheritance model in my situation
because Hibernate would recognize the parent class, while MySQL wouldn't, which
is fine.
